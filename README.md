# UofAmechatronics
This repository countains code, schematics and documentation for a mechatronics project aiming at building an
embeedded acceleration recorder for model rockets based on an analog accelerometer, PIC16F877 and I2C EEPROM.

You can use the code and schematics but we strongly suggest that you read the documentation first, and pay
extra attention to the "if we had to do it agin" part.

Hope this helps!
