								Tasks for 1st weekend | Data to give them

Analog to digital converter:
	
	Pages to read on the A/D PIC16F690 : Analog to digital converter chapter in data sheet: p109-120
		goal is to understand how the built in A/D works, who to programe it etc...
		look for : how the A/D opperates, (conversion cycles, output format, conversion time, specail events, interupts, conversion termination...)
		understanding the role of the dedecated registers, note down the ones most probably need for quicker acces to the info later.
		look through and understand the example page 114.
		look at the Aquisition requierments, is there a specific way to wire the analog input the hardware team should know about?
		strongly recomend to take down notes of the important and usefull information to have it quickly available when working on the A/DC. 
	
Hardware :
    Your first task is absolutly essential as it will set the basis for other groups: you need to come up with a list of componants for the project.
    The first thing you'll need to do is refer to the specifications of the project which states that we MUST use a PIC16F690, an accelerometer with analog output and serial EEPROM.
    Then you'll have to have a look on what exists outhere in term of componants. I suggest having a look on digikey.com, mouser.com or even Adafruit.com or sparfun.com.
    You'll find out that those componants have a range of specifications and you'll have to set a value for those. For instance: do you need a +/-2g accelerometer or a +/-16g ?
    Keep in mind that the core of the project is the PIC and that it has electical specifications... 
    We need you to come tu us by friday at midnight with a list of componants, being totaly sure about them fulfilling all the requirements and able to provide them on time (ie less than 8 days).
    
	- Guidlines to list of components: 
				- what? 
				- Quick requierment list for each component.
				- Important stuff to look for (ex: max operation voltage)
	-> Goal: learn what to look for with each component, what data to compare, what does that change in
			 how if works.
