								Tasks for 1st weekend | Data to give them

Analog to digital converter:
	
	Pages to read on the A/D PIC16F690 : Analog to digital converter chapter in data sheet: p109-120
		goal is to understand how the built in A/D works, who to programe it etc...
		look for : how the A/D opperates, (conversion cycles, output format, conversion time, specail events, interupts, conversion termination...)
		understanding the role of the dedecated registers, note down the ones most probably need for quicker acces to the info later.
		look through and understand the example page 114.
		look at the Aquisition requierments, is there a specific way to wire the analog input the hardware team should know about?
		strongly recomend to take down notes of the important and usefull information to have it quickly available when working on the A/DC. 
	
Hardware :
	- Guidlines to list of components: 
				- what? 
				- Quick requierment list for each component.
				- Important stuff to look for (ex: max operation voltage)
	-> Goal: learn what to look for with each component, what data to compare, what does that change in
			 how if works. 
			 
Data management :
